"it has it's inverse effect on health as well as it contains handsenitiser and triclosan which is used as a cleaning agent in laundry detergent.

"soap for teethColgate might be better suited as a body wash, the taste is like soap that stays in your mouth without any fresh taste. This product is gross and I have gone to a more expensive brand for my family, never buying colgate again.",Negative,,
I was suffering from bad breath and gum problems So I thought of trying Colgate total toothpaste as it’s ads looked promising as they say it gives the total care and and it keeps fresh for 12 hours.I started using This toothpaste twice a day to get best results but it didn’t worked for me. They only tell exaggerating lies in their ads And it never works as they say.,Negative,,
Do NOT buy this colgate paste. I would like to tell you what I recently found out about colgate toothpaste. The red rectangle little box on the toothpaste states whether the contents of the tooth paste is produced with natural herbs or with artificially produced things. The red mark states for artificial products and green mark for natural. The products of colgate contains red mark which means it is just an artificially produced product which will do no good to you nor to your teeth. Colgate is famous just for its brand name and its advertisements. Stop buying artificail things like colgate which actually does no good to you.,Negative,,
Wont ever use this again in my life,Negative,,
Colgate's effectiveness and flavor variety failed to meet my expectations.,Negative,,
